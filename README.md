# Internships

Welcome to my personal Internship Guide! 

Over the past few years, I have compiled this guide based on my own experiences in teaching and coaching students in Human-Computer Interaction and UX design. For those interested in applying for jobs in this domain, the guide aims to provide you with practical advice to help you navigate the internship (job) application.


## Application

**First off, I recommend writing lots of applications, min. 30!** \
**Be prepared that many companies will take time to reply, or will not reply at all to your application.**
